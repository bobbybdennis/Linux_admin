1. Deal with web server (open needed ports, and forward port 80 traffic to 8080)
#!/bin/bash

read asnwer
if [[ "$answer" == "yes" ]]; then
read answer
#This will open the ports for 80 to traffic 8080 on your server

     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
     sudo iptables -S


2. Deal with MySQL service (open needed ports)
#!/bin/bash

echo " would you like to close MYSQL? yes or no?"
read answer 
if [[ "$answer" == "yes" ]]; then
#this command will open the MYSQL feature port for your server
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -j ACCEPT
     sudo iptables -S
3. Deal with SSH service (allow incoming and outgoing SSH, second script to deny SSH)

4. Deal with Email service (Such as allow or block incoming SMTP,POP3...)
#!/bin/bash
echo " Would you like to lockdown your email smtp ports? yes or no" 

if[[ "$answer" -- " yes" ]]; then
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -j REJECT
     
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 465 -j REJECT
     
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 587 -j REJECT

     sudo iptables -S
fi


5. Script to allow/block specific hosts, MAC addresses, block telnet, block ping
#!/bin/bash

echo " what mac address would you like to block?"
read macadd
#this will block all targeted mac addresses that you enter,ping requests and telnet access
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m mac --mac-source $macadd -j DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT --proto icmp -j DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 23 -j DROP



6. Write a script to backup your Firewall/iptables
#!/bin/bash
#this will save your current config for your iptables incase your server goes down or you need to restore back to a config you like
iptables-save > iptables.bak

#!/bin/bash
#the following script will restore your targeted file to restore your saved ip tables
iptables-restore < iptables.bak  




Write the specs for how you think you could prevent a DDOS attack using IPtables.  Can you write a script for this?


You would take what information you have of who is attakcing your server and run the scripts to block those specific MAC address and IP addresses that you see.
Yes it is possible to write a script for this and just run it each time you see a new ip address attempting to DDOs your server.
